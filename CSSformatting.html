<header><h1>The Importance of Restaurant Etiquette</h1> </header>
<p>
A few weeks ago, I was working a brunch serving shift at French Meadow Cafe 
in St. Paul on a particularly steady day. Towards the end of my shift, I served a 
booth with two men who ordered two cocktails, appetizers, and five entrees; their bill 
was about $120 total. While completing my shift review and adjusting tips at the end 
of my shift, I noticed that I received a $9 tip on their bill. In other words, a 7.5%
tip. Later on I realized that many of my tables tipped me under 20%, even if it was just a few dollars 
under. This was frustrating for me as someone who takes pride in her attentive service. Right now, we are in
 "the slow season" where restaurants generally get less customers due to post-holiday finances and cold weather.
  People prefer to stay warm at home in the winter, saving money after Christmas expenses. For us servers, 
  less customers means less money for us, as the majority of our pay relies on tips; so to receive less than
   expected for your labor on top of that is disheartening and disappointing. I'm writing about this issue
    to draw attention to the ways customers make servers lose money, and how to prevent it. </p>

</figure><h2>So, why is tipping so important?</h2>
	<p>As a server, I can attest that the majority of my paycheck is money earned from tips, <em>not</em> hourly wage. 
    Tips are my livelihood; My tips are how I afford the following:</p> 
   <ul>
    <li>Groceries</li> 
    <li>Gas</li> 
    <li>Rent</li>
    <li>Utilities</li>
</ul>
    <p> Most people don't know that 
    minimum wage for servers is typically much lower than average. I'm very fortunate to be employed in the 
    Twin Cities, where a $15/hr. minimum wage is required, but throughout <a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/minnesota-laws-tipped-employees.html">Minnesota</a> minimum wage for tipped 
    workers is $11.13/hr, and where I'm from in <a href="https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/iowa-laws-tipped-employees.html">Iowa</a>, minimum wage for tipped workers is $4.35/hr.; it's safe 
    to say neither of these wages are livable. Because this isn't common knowledge, customers often downplay
     the importance of tipping, which is detrimental to servers and food service workers over time who rely 
     on tips for their livelihood. Customers don't realize the things they do that contribute to servers 
     losing out on money, and in my experience, there are three avoidable things that cause this most.</p>


<h2>Always be prepared to tip 20%</h2>
	<p>First, heavily related to the example I used in the introduction, customers who go out to eat might use 
    an expensive bill as a means to underpay the server. Sometimes the thought process goes as follows: "A $20 
    tip is objectively good, so it doesn't matter if I leave $20 on a $150 tab" or "Jeez, this bill is expensive! 
    A little steep to be tipping 20%..." I don't have to spell it out, the problem with this is obvious, yet 
    surprisingly common. If you can afford an expensive meal at a nice restaurant, you can afford to tip 20%.</p> 

<h2>If using a gift card or discount, tip 20% on the original bill</h2>
<p>Second, customers don't realize that although discounts and gift cards cover your meal, they do <strong>not</strong> cover the service.
 Here is what I mean: when a meal is discounted, a new ticket is printed that lists the total, discounted amount, and 
 remaining balance; the issue arises once the customer pays the remaining balance and tips based on that number instead
  of the total. Hypothetically, if you and a friend went to a nice restaurant, ordered two drinks, one appetizer, two 
  entrees, and two desserts, all totaling $100, would it be fair for your server to receive a $10 tip after the $50 
  discount is applied? It is not, because the $10 tip only covers half of the work done by your server. Even if your 
  bill is half off, it's expected you pay your server 20% of the pre-discount total to compensate for the work done.</p>

  <h2>Don't take up your table for long after paying</h2>
<p>Third, customers hardly realize that by taking up a table after closing out contributes to servers losing out on money. 
This is an occurrence I experience often. What usually happens is a table, typically of two or more people, is sat in a 
server's section on a high volume day, and after they pay for their meal and all is settled, they continue to sit and 
talk for a long period of time. When customers do this, they take up a table that could be occupied by new paying customers; 
if customers take up a table for an hour and a half after closing out their tab, they're indirectly robbing a server of two 
tables, and therefore preventing them from earning more money. It's more appropriate to leave after you pay, and chat elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  It's important to write about these issues to inform and educate people on why tipping properly for good service is 
essential, as well as remind patrons to practice restaurant etiquette and be considerate of the server and the restaurant. 
If there's one thing I want readers to understand from this, it's that a little extra money can go a long way for a server
 who shows up every day to make a living.

<h1>Project Summary</h1>
<p>
The first thing I did when I transferred the document to GitHub was move the lines so that I could see everything. Because I had 
the line settings to "no wrap", they continued to run off of the screen where I couldn't see them, so it was important to fix
this first. Then, I went ahead and applied paragraphs so that I could see where each section of my essay started and ended. I wrote
this essay back in February, so I couldn't remember exactly what I wrote. I gave my essay a skim to remind myself
of the main ideas, and once I feld comfortable enough, I applied headings to my sections based on what each paragraph was about.
I noticed that when I transferred the original document and checked on the format of the HTML doc outside of GitHub, the apostrophes
and quotes translated into random symbols, making my document extremely hard to read. To fix this, I went back through my writing
again, deleting and retyping apostrophes and quotes until it looked normal and readable. </p>

<p>After applying the main substantive edits, I applied bold and italic text to words that seemed fit, which I realized after this
 exercise that I don't really use a lot of italic or bold text in my writing. This is something I'd like to 
 change as they help shape the tone of my writing. I applied links to the section about different state's minimum wage laws because
 those links were found in my original bibliography. I didn't have any existing lists in the original document, so I edited one of my
 sections from sentence format to an unordered list. Lastly, I found an image of a waitress taking orders from a table on Pexels, downloaded 
 the smallest size, and inserted it into the document.
